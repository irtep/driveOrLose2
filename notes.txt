bugs:
  after completing the last race of championships, it didnt stop when race stopped, i needed to break my car.
  also at afterRace it still offered the next race.

  doesnt stop to side walls... it looks like the walls are too small

  this happens at afterRace:
  Can't perform a React state update on an unmounted component. This is a no-op, but it indicates a memory leak in your application. To fix, cancel all subscriptions and asynchronous tasks in the componentWillUnmount method.
    in Race (created by App)
